- `/perform-checks`
    - command to run all checks (lint, formatting, tests, and build checks) at once.
    - Highly recommended to use this command instead of running checks manually one by one, as it ensures that all checks are run and that no issues are missed.
    - When making a TODO list that modifies code it is recommended that you add to run this command.
